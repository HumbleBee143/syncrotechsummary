Hi, it's Aiman Ahmad with rosewood care, just spoke to David. I'm just trying to login with admin privileges to a pc that's been added to the active directory, but I'm not sure what the details are for the IT Admin account. Could you please take a look and let me know? Thank you.

Hi David, I've double checked the asset and Syncro is working on the device. Let me know if there's any further issues. Daniel
---
Hi Daniel, I've just checked the laptop, and Syncro isn't showing in the icon tray, I'm not sure if this means it isn't working correctly though Thanks,
---
Hi David, I can see this device is appearing in Syncro now and looks to be working, are there any further issues with this? Daniel
---
Hi David, It came through and I have accepted the device. Let me know if Syncro appears now. Daniel
---
Hi Daniel, I rebooted the laptop and reinstalled. Please could you accept the machine join on your end Thanks,
---
Hi David, If you reboot the laptop and then try to run the syncro installer again it should show up for me to accept it again. Daniel
---
Hi Daniel, I've downloaded the script successfully and have run it on the affected laptop, am I okay to just re-run the syncro installer again now? Thanks,
---
Hi David, Could you try this WeTransfer link instead? I suspect it might have gotten blocked over e-mail. Let me know if this works. Daniel
---
Hi Daniel, Sorry, I don't seem to have received the email in which you included the zip file for some reason. Would you mind sending that over again? Thanks,
---
Hi David, Did you manage to run the script on the device? I haven't seen it pop in Syncro yet. Daniel
---
Hi David, No problem, I've attached the .zip containing the script. I will delete the device out of syncro, if you run the script provided, restart the device and then reinstall Syncro I'll accept it again. Daniel
---
Hi Daniel, Syncro hasn't shown up on the laptop yet. Please could you provide the script to remove the registry entries? Thanks,
---
Hi David, I accepted the laptop when it came in earlier - has it not showed up in the system tray yet? I can delete it out of Syncro so it can be re-added in, but you may need to run a script to fully clear out the registry entries that it creates. I can either provide you the script to do it or I can jump on the machine and do it? Let me know which you'd prefer. Daniel

Hi Daniel, That is great, I have done a couple of tests, and it seems to be working fine when I use the browser. Thanks so much for your help.

Hi Bec, In the desktop version of outlook it appears like it's not possible to hide the invitees. However, I've went into the web version of Outlook and setup a test meeting in there. There is a tick box you can select which hides the attendees list. I've attached a screenshot of it. I tested it and the colleague I invited to the meeting could not see my personal e-mail address that was also invited to the meeting. You could try testing this also to see if it works for you? Other alternatives would be to invite each person individually (not really feasible if you have loads of people to invite) or you could create the meeting not inviting anyone, copy the meeting link and then e-mail the meeting link over via BCC. Let me know if this is of any help or if you need anything else. Daniel
---
Hi, I wonder if you could help me with a question rather than a problem with the system. I need to set up a meeting in Outlook, and I know I cannot Bcc attendees. Is there a way that I can create a meeting and not have the individuals’ details showing? I have tried compiling a distribution list but have realised that if there is any issue at all with any email address it shows all contacts in the attendee list. Do you know if there is a solution to this?

Hi Bigfoot, Conferencing facilities, we currently have a large tv that we use in our board room, we cast to it from our laptops using 'windows K' However we have to then use our laptop camera and microphone which looks unprofessional to clients.

Hi Cai, Thanks for bearing with us while we’ve looked into this. We’ve confirmed that the issue is down to Google being very strict about email authentication. In this case, emails sent from @me.com addresses are being blocked before they reach the recipient’s email system, so there isn’t a way for us to allow or release them on their side. The @me.com address is an older Apple iCloud email domain that’s fully owned and managed by Apple. Because of that, it isn’t possible to change or improve how it authenticates, and Google won’t accept these messages if they don’t meet its current security requirements. As a workaround, do you have another email address you could try sending from (for example @caiand.co.uk, @onceuponatown.co.uk, Gmail, or similar)? That should go through without any issues. Thanks

Hi Cai, It seems that there issues with @me.com e-mail addresses having trouble sending to Gmail based e-mail addresses. I have added additional rules to try and get these allowed. Can you try this again and let me know if there are still issues. Daniel

Hi Daniel. There were no attachments, and yes I receive the same message every time I try to email them. I’ve never experienced this while sending emails to anyone else. Thanks Cai Designer Founder of Once Upon a Town 07966 264 122 [ [

Hi Cai, Were there any attachments sent in the e-mail that you received a bounceback for? Does this happen every time you try to e-mail them? Daniel

Hi Racheal, I am looking in the restricted users in the Microsoft portal and there are no blocked users - is this still not working with the same error messages? Daniel

Hi Jerome, No problem I have made the changes so it is now: Monday–Friday (9:00am–5:30pm) -Office phones (20s) -Mobiles (20s) -Voicemail Mailbox Friday–Monday (5:30pm–9:00am) -Mobiles (20s) -Voicemail Mailbox Please let me know if the voicemail gives you issues and we can further investigate. Thanks
---
Hi Matthew, Could you amend the times to the following: Monday–Friday (9:00am–5:30pm) • Ring the office phones (both) for 20 seconds • Then ring the mobiles (both) for 20 seconds • Then divert to the voicemail mailbox Friday–Monday (5:30pm–9:00am) • Ring the mobiles (both) for 20 seconds • Then divert to the voicemail mailbox Let me know and we’ll then check the mailbox is clicking in (it seemed to be a problem). Jerome
---
Hi Jerome, Yes, that’s correct. The call flow would be as follows: Monday–Friday (8:00am–6:00pm) • Ring the office phones (both) for 20 seconds • Then ring the mobiles (both) for 20 seconds • Then divert to the voicemail mailbox Friday–Monday (6:00pm–8:00am) • Ring the mobiles (both) for 20 seconds • Then divert to the voicemail mailbox
---
Hi Matthew, Just to check your message does the system ring the numbers in sequence - office (both), mobiles (both) then the mailbox? The OOH plan sounds fine – if that also covers Friday 6:00pm to Monday 8:00am. Jerome
---
Hi Jerome, Hope you are well, I have made the following changes: - I have renamed EXT 203 to Daria - Added a time profile which points phones to main phones in hours (8-6 Mon-Fri) and mobiles out of hours Both phones would ring at the same time when the call hits the main phone group and both mobiles would ring when the mobile group is hit. It would take around 50-60 seconds to hit the voicemail due to the 20-second ring on both main phones and mobiles. Does this sound OK? Thanks
---
Hi Daniel, Okay, so extension 202 is Julian and 203 is now Daria Dmytriieva. Are both office extensions set to ring at the same time? Do calls go to both mobile numbers at the same time or one after the other? The test calls made seemed to suggest the message box wasn’t clicking in, but I can‘t say for certain? Are you able to set the phones to go directly to the mobiles out of hours week days and weekends – eg after 6:00pm and before 8:00am Monday to Friday. Jerome
---
Hi Jerome, Currently the phones are set to ring the main group, which goes to extensions 202 and 203 (labelled Julian and Ashleigh), but these are set to be active 24/7 with a failover going to Les and Julian's mobiles if they're not answered after 20 seconds. Daniel
---
Hi Daniel, It is reported that the calls were just dropping off, not going to voicemail. But I wasn’t doing the testing so I can’t say for sure what was happening. I thought if we checked what’s set up we could see if that’s what is happening. Jerome
---
Hi Jerome, Was it immediately going to voicemail when calling during the weekend? Daniel
---
Hi, We wanted to check the phone transfer pattern. There was some testing over the weekend and calls dropped out before ringing. Are you able to provide the call pattern set currently so we can check it. Many thanks, Jerome

Hi Matthew, I have set up the softphones for Brendan and Linda as requested: Brendan is extension 220 Linda is extension 221 I've attached the softphone QR codes too so they can set it up. Any issue or questions please let me know. Daniel

---
Hi Matthew, Do the new starters require their own direct number, or will they be using the normal office number? Daniel
---
Hi Matthew, I will set these up for you and I will let you know when it has been done or if I require any further information. Daniel
