There is a tick box you can select which hides the attendees list. I\u0027ve attached a screenshot of it. I tested it and the colleague I invited to the meeting could not see my personal e-mail address that was also invited to the meeting. You could try testing this also to see if it works for you?\n\nOther alternatives would be to invite each person individually (not really feasible if you have loads of people to invite) or you could create the meeting not inviting anyone, copy the meeting link and then e-mail the meeting link over via BCC.\n\nLet me know if this is of any help or if you need anything else.\n\nKind regards,\n\nDaniel",

In this case, emails sent from @me.com addresses are being blocked before they reach the recipient’s email system, so there isn’t a way for us to allow or release them on their side.\n\nThe @me.com address is an older Apple iCloud email domain that’s fully owned and managed by Apple. Because of that, it isn’t possible to change or improve how it authenticates, and Google won’t accept these messages if they don’t meet its current security requirements.\n\nAs a workaround, do you have another email address you could try sending from (for example @caiand.co.uk, @onceuponatown.co.uk, Gmail, or similar)? That should go through without any issues.\n\nThanks",

                           "Hi Josh,\n\nBelow is the email explaining the issue\n\n\"Thanks for bearing with us while we’ve looked into this.\n\nWe’ve confirmed that the issue is down to Google being very strict about email authentication. In this case, emails sent from @me.com addresses are being blocked before they reach the recipient’s email system, so there isn’t a way for us to allow or release them on their side.\n\nThe @me.com address is an older Apple iCloud email domain that’s fully owned and managed by Apple. Because of that, it isn’t possible to change or improve how it authenticates, and Google won’t accept these messages if they don’t meet its current security requirements.\n\nAs a workaround, do you have another email address you could try sending from (for example @caiand.co.uk, @onceuponatown.co.uk, Gmail, or similar)? That should go through without any issues.\"\nThanks",

                         "Hi John,\n\nAs spoken on the phone this issue is due to the fact that your GT piping email was syncing down the sharepoint onto your device. However as it now only has an exchange plan 1 it has lost access to onedrive and therefore will no longer sync.\nTo get around this we could look to upgrade your license to a business basic which would license onedrive and allow it to continue syncing.\n\nCurrently the GT piping sharepoint holds 109GB of data which can be accessed from the below site\nhttps://gtpipingsolutions.sharepoint.com/sites/GTPiping/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx\nLet me know how you would like to go forward with this.\n\nThanks,\nDavid",

                      "Hi Christine,\n\n[185.2.77.72 | VoiceHost Ltd | AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/185.2.77.72?page=1#report)\n\nAfter reviewing the above IP reputation reports, your public IP address (185.2.77.72 – VoiceHost Ltd) has been flagged 594 times on AbuseIPDB for various activities, including port scanning, brute-force attempts, SQL injection, and DDoS traffic. This is likely the reason some websites are rejecting connections from your network. The issue may be caused by a local compromise or misconfiguration.\n\nHow to confirm the source\n\nOn the firewall or router:\n\n-\nReview outbound connection logs.\n\n-\nFilter for TCP destination port 1433 or any ports listed on AbuseIPDB.\n\n-\nIdentify the internal source IP generating these outbound attempts.\n\nIf outbound logging isn’t available:\n\n-\nTemporarily enable an egress capture (for example, on a Meraki: Security Center → Outbound Connections or use Packet Capture).\n\n-\nLook for repeated outbound SYN packets to random internet IPs on port 1433.\n\nOnce the source is identified\n\n-\nIsolate or reimage the affected device.\n\n-\nBlock outbound TCP ports 1433/1434 (SQL ports) at the firewall unless they are explicitly required.\n\n-\nChange passwords and ensure all systems are patched.\n\n-\nAfter remediation, recheck AbuseIPDB over the next few days, the reputation score should begin to drop.\n\nOnce the abuse reports subside, we can contact the carrier to submit a delisting request. However, this cannot be done while abusive traffic is still being detected, the most recent report was just two days ago.\n\nIt’s important to address this as soon as possible. Continued abuse activity could lead to this IP being listed on additional blacklists, eventually rendering it unusable and resulting in the loss of a usable IP address from Regent Centre’s allocation.\n\nThanks,",
